# Hopper and pipes
There are different kinds of hoppers in Skyblock, which all have different functions.
## Vanilla Hoppers
The vanilla hopper, also just called "hopper", works the same as in vanilla Minecraft.
## Pipes
A pipe works like an extension of a hopper. It can be connected with hoppers or other pipes, to deliver items from one source to another. Pipes do not have their own inventory, they are a cheaper and more efficient alternative to hopper-chains though.
## Vacuum Hopper
The vacuum hopper works just like a vanilla hopper, the only difference is that it can pick up items in a 9x3x9 area.

## Super Vacuum Hopper
The super vacuum hopper is a stronger version of the vacuum hopper. It can pick up items in a 17x5x17 area.

## Filter Hopper
The filter hopper allows you to filter items, which go through the hopper. To change the filter, you have to Shift + right click on the hopper and put the corresponding item, which you want to filter, in one of the 7 slots of the hopper.
