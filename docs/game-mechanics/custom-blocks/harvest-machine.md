# Harvest Machine
The harvest machine is an essential block for the automisation of the Market Stall. It works just like a farmer villager. The harvest machine scans a 9x9 area for crops and harvests them. If the 9x9 area lights up green, it means everything is according to plan and no crops are missing. If it lights up red, plants are missing.

:::warning
Glowberries, sweet berries, nether warts, and similar crops can NOT be harvested by the harvest machine!
:::
Harvested plants are saved inside the inventory of the harvest machine, which consists of 5 slots. As soon as every slot is full, the harvest machine will drop every newly harvested crop.

By placing a hopper under the harvest machine, you can direct the plants into the hopper and transfer them into a chest by, for example, using pipes or similar.
